# ChessSonnet
It is the Alpha version. It takes a long time to move but has a large neural network
Recommended to install on computers with a powerful gpu & cpu.
It is a self-coded chess ai. It can play on around 600 ELo as of 31/12/2024
The update added a metrics feature which tracks the ai's wins/losses
The ui has become easier to use and the neural network has been simplified a bit to make it more accessible on devices with low RAM.
